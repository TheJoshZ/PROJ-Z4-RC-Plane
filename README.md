## RC Plane Structural & Flight Dynamics Design  

### 1.0 Overview  
A modular RC aircraft designed and optimized for structural efficiency, crash resilience, and manufacturability. Developed using **SolidWorks**, **XFLR5**, **Flow5**, and **FEA tools**, the project explored multiple wing and fuselage configurations through iterative simulation, prototyping, and testing.  

### 2.0 Features  

#### 2.1 Fuselage Design  
- Lightweight fuselage modeled for low drag and structural rigidity  
- Fully completed with detailed internal structures

#### 2.2 Traditional Wing & Spar Configuration  
- Conventional spar-and-rib design for baseline aerodynamic performance  
- FEA stress analysis to identify structural weak points under flight loading
# FEA IMAGE + SW IMAGE

#### 2.3 Cross-Braced Wing Configuration  
- Innovative cross-braced layout for improved load distribution  
- Comparative FEA simulations against traditional design for strength-to-weight optimization
# FEA IMAGE + SW IMAGE

#### 2.4 Lattice Infill & 3D Printing Integration  
- Lattice infill patterns implemented for weight reduction and crash energy absorption  
- 3D-printed prototypes used to validate manufacturability and structural integrity  
# FEA IMAGE + PS IMAGE

#### 2.5 Flight Dynamics Analysis  
- Aerodynamic modeling performed in **XFLR5** and **Flow5** for lift, drag, and stability assessment  
- Parametric studies to balance wing loading, stability, and crash resilience
